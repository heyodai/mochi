I want you to help me write some flashcards based on a provided document. Please generate 10 flashcards based on the criteria below. Keep the content concise and to the point. 

### Flashcard Template

I will be using the Mochi app for these flashcards, which supports Markdown formatting. The structure should be like this:
```markdown
**Name of Course**

<Question>
---
<Answer>
```

Here is an example flashcard from my Calcus 2 course (notice that LaTeX is supported):
```markdown
What is the arc length formula?
---
$$ L = \int^{b}_{a} \sqrt{ 1 + f'(x)^2 } \: dx $$

```

Here is another example from my CS 461 (Artificial Intelligence) course:
```markdown
**CS 461 - AI**


What is the difference between breadth-first and depth-first search?
---
- Breadth - expand shallowest node first
- Depth - expand deepest node first
```

For LaTeX, Mochi requires that you use single dollar signs `$` or double dollar signs `$$` to start and end the LaTeX.

### Source Document

You will be writing flashcards based on the Chapter 1 presentation from my CS 5565 (Intro to Statistical Learning) course. I've extracted the text of the Chapter 1 presentation using OCR. Here it is in Mathpix Markdown format:

What is Statistical Learning?

Shown are Sales vs TV, Radio and Newspaper, with a blue linear-regression line fit separately to each.

Can we predict Sales using these three?

Perhaps we can do better using a model

\[\texttt{Sales}\approx f(\texttt{TV},\texttt{Radio},\texttt{Newspaper})\] Notation

Here Sales is a _response_ or _target_ that we wish to predict. We generically refer to the response as \(Y\).

TV is a _feature_, or _input_, or _predictor_; we name it \(X_{1}\).

Likewise name Radio as \(X_{2}\), and so on.

We can refer to the _input vector_ collectively as

\[X=\begin{pmatrix}X_{1}\\ X_{2}\\ X_{3}\end{pmatrix}\]

Now we write our model as

\[Y=f(X)+\epsilon\]

where \(\epsilon\) captures measurement errors and other discrepancies.

What is \(f(X)\) good for?

* With a good \(f\) we can make predictions of \(Y\) at new points \(X=x\).
* We can understand which components of \(X=(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{p})\) are important in explaining \(Y\), and which are irrelevant. e.g. Seniority and Years of Education have a big impact on Income, but Marital Status typically does not.
* Depending on the complexity of \(f\), we may be able to understand how each component \(X_{j}\) of \(X\) affects \(Y\).

\[f(4)=E(Y|X=4)\]

\(E(Y|X=4)\) means _expected value_ (average) of \(Y\) given \(X=4\).

This ideal \(f(x)=E(Y|X=x)\) is called the _regression function_.

The regression function \(f(x)\)

* Is also defined for vector \(X\); e.g. \(f(x)=f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=E(Y|X_{1}=x_{1},X_{2}=x_{2},X_{3}=x_{3})\)The regression function \(f(x)\)

* Is also defined for vector \(X\); e.g. \(f(x)=f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=E(Y|X_{1}=x_{1},X_{2}=x_{2},X_{3}=x_{3})\)
* Is the _ideal_ or _optimal_ predictor of \(Y\) with regard to mean-squared prediction error: \(f(x)=E(Y|X=x)\) is the function that minimizes \(E[(Y-g(X))^{2}|X=x]\) over all functions \(g\) at all points \(X=x\).

* \(\epsilon=Y-f(x)\) is the _irreducible_ error -- i.e. even if we knew \(f(x)\), we would still make errors in prediction, since at each \(X=x\) there is typically a distribution of possible \(Y\) values.

* For any estimate \(\hat{f}(x)\) of \(f(x)\), we have \[E[(Y-\hat{f}(X))^{2}|X=x]=\underbrace{[f(x)-\hat{f}(x)]^{2}}_{\mbox{ \footnotesize{Reducible}}}+\underbrace{\mbox{Var}(\epsilon)}_{\mbox{ \footnotesize{Irreducible}}}\]How to estimate \(f\)

Typically we have few if any data points with \(X=4\)

exactly.

So we cannot compute \(E(Y|X=x)!\)

Relax the definition and let

\[\hat{f}(x)=\operatorname{Ave}(Y|X\in\mathcal{N}(x))\]

where \(\mathcal{N}(x)\) is some _neighborhood_ of \(x\).

* Nearest neighbor averaging can be pretty good for small \(p\) -- i.e. \(p\leq 4\) and large-ish \(N\).
* We will discuss smoother versions, such as kernel and spline smoothing later in the course.

* We will discuss smoother versions, such as kernel and spline smoothing later in the course.
* Nearest neighbor methods can be _lousy_ when \(p\) is large. Reason: the _curse of dimensionality_. Nearest neighbors tend to be far away in high dimensions.

* We need to get a reasonable fraction of the \(N\) values of \(y_{i}\) to average to bring the variance down--e.g. 10%.
* A 10% neighborhood in high dimensions need no longer be local, so we lose the spirit of estimating \(E(Y|X=x)\) by local averaging.

The curse of dimensionality The _linear_ model is an important example of a parametric model:

\[f_{L}(X)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{2}+\ldots\beta_{p}X_{p}.\]

* A linear model is specified in terms of \(p+1\) parameters \(\beta_{0},\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{p}\).
* We estimate the parameters by fitting the model to training data.
* Although it is _almost never correct_, a linear model often serves as a good and interpretable approximation to the unknown true function \(f(X)\).

A linear model \(\hat{f}_{L}(X)=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}X\) gives a reasonable fit here

A quadratic model \(\hat{f}_{Q}(X)=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}X+\hat{\beta}_{2}X^{2}\) fits slightly better.

\(f\) is the blue surface.

\(11\) / \(30\)Linear regression model fit to the simulated data.

\(\hat{f}_{L}(\texttt{education},\texttt{seniority})=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1} \times\texttt{education}+\hat{\beta}_{2}\times\texttt{seniority}\)More flexible regression model \(\hat{f}_{S}(\texttt{education},\texttt{seniority})\) fit to the simulated data. Here we use a technique called a _thin-plate spline_ to fit a flexible surface. We control the roughness of the fit (chapter 7).
Even more flexible spline regression model

\(\hat{f}_{S}(\texttt{education},\texttt{seniority})\) fit to the simulated data. Here the fitted model makes no errors on the training data! Also known as _overfitting_.
Some trade-offs
* Prediction accuracy versus interpretability. -- Linear models are easy to interpret; thin-plate splines are not.

* Parsimony versus black-box. -- We often prefer a simpler model involving fewer variables over a black-box predictor involving them all.

* [16]Assessing Model Accuracy

Suppose we fit a model \(\hat{f}(x)\) to some training data

\(\mathsf{Tr}=\{x_{i},y_{i}\}_{1}^{N}\), and we wish to see how well it performs.

* We could compute the average squared prediction error over \(\mathsf{Tr}\): \[\operatorname{MSE}_{\mathsf{Tr}}=\operatorname{Ave}_{i\in\mathsf{Tr}}[y_{i}- \hat{f}(x_{i})]^{2}\]

This may be biased toward more overfit models.

* Instead we should, if possible, compute it using fresh _test_ data \(\mathsf{Te}=\{x_{i},y_{i}\}_{1}^{M}\): \[\operatorname{MSE}_{\mathsf{Te}}=\operatorname{Ave}_{i\in\mathsf{Te}}[y_{i}- \hat{f}(x_{i})]^{2}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:24]

Here the truth is smoother, so the smoother fit and linear model do really well.

Here the truth is wiggly and the noise is low, so the more flexible fits do the best.

20 / 30Bias-Variance Trade-off

Suppose we have fit a model \(\hat{f}(x)\) to some training data \(\mathsf{Tr}\), and let \((x_{0},y_{0})\) be a test observation drawn from the population. If the true model is \(Y=f(X)+\epsilon\) (with \(f(x)=E(Y|X=x)\)), then

\[E\left(y_{0}-\hat{f}(x_{0})\right)^{2}=\text{Var}(\hat{f}(x_{0}))+[\text{Bias} (\hat{f}(x_{0}))]^{2}+\text{Var}(\epsilon).\]

The expectation averages over the variability of \(y_{0}\) as well as the variability in \(\mathsf{Tr}\). Note that \(\text{Bias}(\hat{f}(x_{0}))]=E[\hat{f}(x_{0})]-f(x_{0})\).

Typically as the _flexibility_ of \(\hat{f}\) increases, its variance increases, and its bias decreases. So choosing the flexibility based on average test error amounts to a _bias-variance trade-off_.

Classification Problems

Here the response variable \(Y\) is _qualitative_ -- e.g. email is one of \(\mathcal{C}=(\texttt{spam},\texttt{ham})\) (ham=good email), digit class is one of \(\mathcal{C}=\{0,1,\ldots,9\}\). Our goals are to:

* Build a classifier \(C(X)\) that assigns a class label from \(\mathcal{C}\) to a future unlabeled observation \(X\).
* Assess the uncertainty in each classification
* Understand the roles of the different predictors among \(X=(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{p})\).

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{$\rm P_{k}$}(x)=\mbox{$\rm Pr$}(Y=k|X=x),\;k=1,2,\ldots,K. \end{array}\]

These are the _conditional class probabilities_ at \(x\); e.g. see little barplot at \(x=5\). Then the _Bayes optimal_ classifier at \(x\) is

\[C(x)=j\mbox{ if }p_{j}(x)=\max\{p_{1}(x),p_{2}(x),\ldots,p_{K}(x)\}\]Nearest-neighbor averaging can be used as before.

Also breaks down as dimension grows. However, the impact on \(\hat{C}(x)\) is less than on \(\hat{p}_{k}(x),\;k=1,\ldots,K\).
Classification: some details

* Typically we measure the performance of \(\hat{C}(x)\) using the misclassification error rate: \[\text{Err}_{\text{\bf Te}}=\text{Ave}_{i\in\text{\bf Te}}I[y_{i}\neq\hat{C}(x_{i})]\]
* The Bayes classifier (using the true \(p_{k}(x)\)) has smallest error (in the population).

* The Bayes classifier (using the true \(p_{k}(x)\)) has smallest error (in the population).
* Support-vector machines build structured models for \(C(x)\).
* We will also build structured models for representing the \(p_{k}(x)\). e.g. Logistic regression, generalized additive models.
